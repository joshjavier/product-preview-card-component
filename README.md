## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did this project to practice my frontend skills. Since I haven't worked on a frontend project for quite a while, I think I progressed slowly at the beginning as I'm thinking how to structure the workflow in my head. But once I remembered the pieces, it became easier to keep moving.

One thing I noticed is that it's okay - maybe even faster - to just code something shitty that *works*. I know that's something of a mantra in the programming community - "make it work, then make it better" - but a lot of times I want to make things better or pretty the first time, which tends to make progress slow. Something to keep in mind :)

In terms of the code, I learned about the `<picture>` element and used it to show different versions of an image for the mobile and desktop versions. Pretty cool "aha" moment right there. ðŸ’¡
